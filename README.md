Inspired by the artist Alexander Peverett's series of glitch art works 'Computer Graphic Painting', and the fact that many of his creations deal with the field of computer music and computer graphics, and that I have always been interested in glitch art, I find my daily life surrounded by many electronic glitches, physical computer glitches happen all the time, such as the internet These glitches, citing Iman Moradi's classification as 'Clean Glitches', are unintentional, random and real. As annoying as this experience is to me, I find that such faults sometimes open up endless imaginative possibilities.

In my code, I mainly wanted to build a two-dimensional picture this time, hoping to make some noise and crash effects with the two-dimensional code, and I used oscillators and frequencies, adjusting parameters to make it I tried various parameters of sinewave and coswave, as the generation of oscillators and vibration frequencies determines to some extent the sound effects and the formation and changes of the 2D graphics, so I need to keep trying various algorithms, there are also many random algorithms used in it, in which I referred to the code written by my teacher and then chose relatively I had a lot of difficulties in the process of writing it, and I found that I did not have a systematic logic when integrating multiple algorithms and ended up cross-referencing the code to understand some of them. And I found that once I had used some randomly generated algorithms, it was difficult to control them in a way that I wanted them to be, and my code stayed in a rather monotonous variation for most of the first part of the creation, but eventually became richer.

But I actually had another problem that I never solved, I created some background images for the fault effects, but I couldn't place the background image behind the fault lines I wrote, every time I tried to put the image in, the background image always covered my fault lines, no matter which line I added the code to. I have regrets about this assignment, but I know where my skills are weak and I have tried out both 3D and 2D algorithms throughout the assignment, which is equivalent to reviewing most of what I have learnt in the course. I hope I can use this holiday to catch up with everyone else!
