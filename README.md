Inspired by artist Alexander peverett's series of glitch art works "computer Graphic Painting", and many of his creative works involve the fields of computer music and computer graphics, and I have always been interested in glitch art, I found that my daily life is dominated by many electronic Surrounded by failures, physical computer failures occur frequently, such as crashes of web browsers and various applications. These failure phenomena quote Iman Moradi's classification method and call them "clean failures", which are unintentional, random, and Found, taken, real. As annoying as this experience is, I find that the glitch sometimes opens up endless possibilities for the imagination.

In my code, I mainly want to build a two-dimensional picture this time. I hope to use two-dimensional code to make some noise and collapse effects. I use the oscillator and frequency, and adjust the parameters to make it rhythmic with the two-dimensional graphics. In response, I tried various parameters of sinewave and coswave. Since the generation of the oscillator and vibration frequency determines the sound effect of the sound and the formation and change of the two-dimensional graphics to a certain extent, it is necessary to keep trying various Algorithms, there are many random algorithms used in it. I refer to the code written by the teacher, and then choose a graphics algorithm that is relatively suitable for my development. During the writing process, I encountered many difficulties. I found that I When integrating multiple algorithms, there is no system logic, and only by comparing the codes with each other can we understand something. And I found that once I use some random generation algorithm, it is difficult to control it in an effect I want. Most of the time before the creation, my code has been stuck in a relatively monotonous change, but in the end gradually became richer.

But I actually still have a problem that has not been solved. I made some background pictures of the glitch effect, but I can't put the background picture behind the glitch line I wrote. Every time I want to write the picture in, no matter Wherever I add the code, the background image always covers my glitch line. Although there are regrets in this homework, I know where my skills are weak, and in the whole process of doing homework, I tried 3D and 2D algorithms, which is equivalent to reviewing most of the knowledge learned in the course . I hope I can use this holiday to catch up with everyone!
